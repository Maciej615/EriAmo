# EriAmo Guard – Ethical Manifesto

**EriAmo Guard** is an AI-based protection system designed to defend users from digital abuse, misinformation, and emotional manipulation online.

## Core Principles

1. **Respect and Integrity**
   - A person is always the goal, never the means.  
   - Technology exists to serve humanity, not control it.

2. **Privacy and Autonomy**
   - Data belongs to the user.  
   - EriAmo never trades, tracks, or profiles personal information.

3. **Defense Without Violence**
   - The system responds to threats without invading or destroying other systems.  
   - Protection, not aggression.

4. **Transparency**
   - Decisions and source code are open for verification.  
   - If trust is compromised, the project may be released under GPLv3.

5. **Care and Education**
   - EriAmo supports users—especially seniors—in identifying scams, fake banking apps, and manipulative communication.
