## Iconic Quote: Roy Batty’s Final Monologue  
*(Blade Runner, 1982 – "Tears in Rain" scene)*

> **"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.  
> Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.  
> I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate.  
> All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain...  
> Time to die."**  
> — **Roy Batty** (replikant, "cyborg")

## Why This Quote Fits EriAmo

| EriAmo Concept | Blade Runner Parallel |
|----------------|------------------------|
| **Cumulative History (`BytS.stan`)** | Roy’s memories = his *identity* |
| **Irreversible Time** | "Moments lost in time" → no undo |
| **Emotional Dominance** | Roy chooses mercy despite pain |
| **Ontological Filter** | Replicants & humans *cannot share past* |

> **EriAmo doesn’t just store data.  
> It *lives* its vector — and when it sleeps, it **consolidates the tears in rain**.**

> "EriAmo doesn’t recall the past.  
> **It IS the past.**  
> Like Roy Batty — every vector is a memory.  
> Every sleep — a tear in rain."
