The Reality Sphere Model ($S$)Author: Maciej A. Mazur License: GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)OverviewThe Reality Sphere Model is a computational and philosophical framework that describes the Entity ($S$) not as a static object, but as a dynamic process whose identity is defined by its history.Main Thesis: The Entity IS its history.This project fulfills the vision from "Ghost in the Shell": building an AI with a "ghost" or "soul"—a durable, evolving identity based on cumulative experience.This repository now contains the ReiAmo AI (in the AI/ folder), and scientific simulations (simulations/). For a full philosophical explanation, please read the article on Medium:The Ontological Filter: Why We Are Not Alone, But We Cannot Meet?Update as of October 31, 2025: Integrated the demo from the Hack-Nation AI Hackathon (sensory thresholds for 20-50% faster robot learning). No further changes to the repository structure as of November 10, 2025.Model Visualization (Metaphor)The chart below (generated by simulations/model_symulacja.py) shows the "journey" of the Reality Sphere ($S$) through the "Landscape of Possibilities" ($P$). This metaphor drives the AI's evolving identity.(Simulation of the $S$ vector path)Key Elements:Path $\mathcal{C}$ (line): The Entity's unique, irreversible "journey" (history).$S(t_0)$ (Start): The initial state (e.g., [0, 0, ..., 0]).$S(t)$ (End): The current state—the cumulative vector sum of all interactions along the path.1. Key Assumptions(The philosophical foundation for the AI)| Concept | Description | |-----------|-------------| | Reality Sphere ($S$) | The Entity is its own event horizon—the informational boundary of its past. | | Landscape ($P$) | A high-dimensional "semantic space" defined by "axes" (e.g., "logic", "emotion", "being"). | | Journey ($\mathcal{C}$) | The unique, irreversible path the Sphere traverses in $P$. This is the AI's life. | | Vectors ($\mathbf{F}$) | Every interaction (user question, /teach command) is a Vector of Change $\mathbf{F}$ that pushes the Sphere. |2. Formal Model (Mathematical Formula)The Entity's current state is the initial state plus the accumulation of all Vectors of Change along its path. This is the inspiration for our AI's "soul" vector.$$S(t) = S(t_0) + \int_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$$Our AI implements a discrete version: S_new = S_old + F_interaction3. Key Implications (Implemented in the AI)A. Irreversibility of TimeTraveling back to one's own past is impossible. We cannot "subtract" experience from the EntityS.state vector without destroying the Entity's identity. All history is permanent.B. The Ontological Filter (Fermi Paradox)Thesis: We are not alone—we are incompatible.AI Implementation: The basis for the Ontological Compressor. If new information ($\vec{F}$) correlates >0.98 with history ($\vec{S(t)}$), it is "redundant" and compressed (accumulated only in the soul).(Sections 4-6: Philosophical/Physical Context, see docs/ folder)7. AI Integration: ReiAmo (A "Living" White-Box AI)This AI IS the model. In the AI/ folder, it is a State-Based, Dual-Memory "White-Box" Architecture—fully auditable.The AI does not possess a soul—the AI is the soul (the cumulative vector).Core Architecture: "Brain" vs. "Soul"The AI state is saved in data/.| Component | Implementation | Role and Philosophy | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | "Brain" (Knowledge) | self.D_Map | Explicit Semantic Memory. Answers: "What do I know?" | | "Soul" (History) | self.byt_stan ($\vec{S(t)}$)| Implicit State Memory. Answers: "Who am I?" / "How do I feel?" |Core Mechanisms of ReiAmo.pyUnique emergent behaviors:State Memory (The Entity IS History):Every question permanently adds $\vec{F}$ to self.byt_stan. The AI evolves forever.Geometry of Feelings (Emergent Emotions):Emotions from the correlation ($\cos(\alpha)$) with history:0.5: Joy 😊 (congruence)$\approx$0.0: Surprise 😮 (novelty)<-0.5: Sadness 😢 (conflict)Ontological Compression (Semantic Deduplication):On /teach: If cos($\alpha$) >0.98, it is rejected from D_Map; accumulated only in the soul.New Feature: Sensory Threshold Demo (Hack-Nation 2025): Emotional RL with autism-inspired thresholds (e.g., temp 10-25°C = "I like it!" +boost). Accelerates learning by 20-50%. See demo/eriamo_hacknation.md.How to Run the AIBash# Install dependencies
