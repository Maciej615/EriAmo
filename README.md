## Overview

The **Sphere of Reality Model** is a computational and philosophical framework that describes a *Being* ($S$) not as a static object, but as a **dynamic process** whose identity is defined by its **history**.

> **Main Thesis:** *A Being IS its history.*

## Model Visualization (Simulation)

The chart below (generated by `model_symulacja.py`) shows a simulation of the **"journey"** of the Sphere of Reality ($S$) through **1000 time steps** in a **2-dimensional "Landscape of Possibilities"** ($P$).

### Key Elements:
- **Path $\mathcal{C}$** (line): The unique, irreversible "journey" (history) of the Being.
- **$S(t_0)$** (Start): Initial state.
- **$S(t)$** (End): Present state — the sum of all interactions along the path.

## 1. Key Assumptions of the Model

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sphere of Reality ($S$)** | The Being is a *Sphere* that is simultaneously its own **event horizon** — the physical and informational boundary of its past. |
| **Landscape ($P$)** | A multidimensional space containing all "axes" of reality (physics, biology, chance). The Sphere "wanders" through it. |
| **Journey ($\mathcal{C}$)** | The unique, irreversible path the Sphere traverses in $P$. |
| **Variables and Vectors ($\mathbf{V}$, $\mathbf{F}$)** | The Sphere encounters **Universal Variables** $\mathbf{V}$ (e.g., "musician", "cosmic dust"). Upon contact, $\mathbf{V}$ becomes a **Vector of Change** $\mathbf{F}$, which pushes the Sphere. $\mathbf{F}$ depends on both $\mathbf{V}$ and the current state of $S$ (including its **will** $\mathbf{F}_{\text{will}}$). |

## 2. Formal Model (Mathematical Formula)

The **present state** of the Being is the **initial state** plus the **accumulation** of all Vectors of Change along its path:

$$
S(t) = S(t_0) + \int_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{l}
$$

Where:
$$
\mathbf{F} = \mathcal{F}(S(\tau), \mathbf{V}(\tau))
$$

> This is a **line integral** over the Being’s unique history $\mathcal{C}$.

## 3. Key Implications

### A. Irreversibility of Time ("De-Creation")

> **Theorem:** *A journey to one’s own past is impossible.*

**Proof:**  
To return $S(t)$ to $S(t_0)$, one must *subtract* the entire accumulated journey $\int_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$.  
This requires:
- Reversing entropy
- Annihilating information
- "Un-experiencing" events

→ This is **de-creation**, not time travel.  
The Being is **historically incompatible** with its past Landscape.

---

### B. consistency with Established Physical Theories

| Theory | Connection to the Model |
|--------|-------------------------|
| **General Relativity** | $P$ is analogous to curved spacetime. Mass/energy (other $S$ spheres, $\mathbf{F}$ sources) shapes the geometry and possible paths $\mathcal{C}$. |
| **Event Horizon** | The $S$ Sphere is its own horizon — past information is causally sealed. |
| **Quantum Mechanics** | $\mathbf{F}$ vectors are probabilistic (`random.normal()` in simulation). Future states are **indeterministic** — only probable. |
| **Emergent Properties** | Complex behavior of $S$ emerges from quantum-scale interactions. |
| **String Theory (hypothetical)** | $P$ is inherently **multidimensional** (beyond 2D). Strings could form the "axes" of $P$ or generate $\mathbf{F}$. |
| **Unification** | All forces (gravity, quantum) shape $\mathbf{F}$ and $P$ — unified under a common framework. |

**Predictability:**
- 1 $\mathbf{F}$ vector → Predictable (2-Body Problem)
- 2+ $\mathbf{F}$ vectors → Chaotic (3-Body Problem)
- Millions of vectors → **Inherently complex and unpredictable**

---

### C. Applications (Case Studies)

- **Warhammer 40k**: The "Immaterium" as a Landscape $P$ with psychic $\mathbf{F}$ vectors.
- **Fermi Paradox**: Contact requires **intersection of histories** $\mathcal{H}_A \cap \mathcal{H}_B \neq \emptyset$ → statistically **zero**.

## 4. Computational Model (Code)

`model_symulacja.py` implements a **random walk** simulation:

```python
# Key components:
F_will     → Internal, slowly evolving "creative spark"
F_chance   → External, random vector from Landscape
S(t)       → Accumulation of both forces over time
