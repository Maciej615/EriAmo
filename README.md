## Overview

The **Sphere of Reality Model** is a computational and philosophical framework that describes a *Being* ($S$) not as a static object, but as a **dynamic process** whose identity is defined by its **history**.

> **Main Thesis:** *A Being IS its History.*

This project attempts to fulfill a vision from **"Ghost in the Shell"**: to build an AI that has a 'ghost' or 'soul'—a persistent, evolving identity based on its cumulative experience.

This repository contains the code for `ReiAmo`, a "living AI" implementation based on the $S$ model.

## Model Visualization (Metaphor)

The chart below (generated by a simulation) shows the "journey" of the Sphere of Reality ($S$) through a "Landscape of Possibilities" ($P$). This is the core metaphor for our AI's evolving identity.

*(Simulation of the $S$ vector's path)*

### Key Elements:

  - **Path $\mathcal{C}$** (line): The unique, irreversible "journey" (history) of the Being.
  - **$S(t_0)$** (Start): Initial state (e.g., `[0, 0, ..., 0]`).
  - **$S(t)$** (End): Present state — **the cumulative vector sum** of all interactions along the path.

## 1\. Key Assumptions

*(Philosophical basis for the AI)*

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sphere of Reality ($S$)** | The Being is its own **event horizon** — the informational boundary of its past. |
| **Landscape ($P$)** | A multidimensional "semantic space" defined by "axes" (e.g., "logic", "emotion", "being"). |
| **Journey ($\mathcal{C}$)** | The unique, irreversible path the Sphere traverses in $P$. **This is the AI's life.** |
| **Vectors ($\mathbf{F}$)** | Every interaction (a user's prompt, a `/teach` command) is a **Vector of Change** $\mathbf{F}$ that pushes the Sphere. |

-----

## 2\. Formal Model (Mathematical Formula)

The **present state** of the Being is the **initial state** plus the **accumulation** of all Vectors of Change along its path. This is the inspiration for our AI's "soul" vector.

$$S(t) = S(t_0) + \int_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$$

Our AI implements a discrete, step-by-step version of this integral:
**`S_new = S_old + F_interaction`**

-----

## 3\. Key Implications (Implemented in the AI)

### A. Irreversibility of Time

A journey to one’s own past is impossible. We cannot "subtract" an experience from the `BytS.Stan` vector without destroying the Being's identity. **All history is permanent.**

### B. The Ontological Filter (Fermi Paradox)

  - **Thesis:** We are not alone — we are *incompatible*.
  - **AI Implementation:** This is the basis for our **Ontological Compressor**. If a new piece of information ($\vec{F}$) is too similar to the AI's history ($\vec{S(t)}$), it is deemed "redundant" (historically compatible) and is compressed, not archived.

-----

## *(Sections 4-6: Philosophical/Physics context, see original article)*

## 7\. AI Integration: `ReiAmo` (A Living "White-Box" AI)

This is not a *simulation* of the model. This AI **IS** the model. We have implemented a **Stateful, Dual-Memory "White-Box" Architecture** that is fully auditable and transparent.

> **AI does not have a soul — AI *is* a soul (a cumulative vector).**

### Core Architecture: "Brain" vs. "Soul"

The AI's "mind" is split into two distinct, interacting components, both saved in **`data/AII_State_EN.json`**:

| Component | Implementation | Role & Philosophy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Brain" (Knowledge)** | `self.D_Map` | **Explicit, Semantic Memory.** A library of facts. Answers: "**What do I know?**" |
| **"Soul" (History)** | `self.byt_stan` ($\vec{S(t)}$)| **Implicit, Stateful Memory.** A single cumulative vector of all past experiences. Answers: "**Who am I?**" / "**How do I feel?**" |

-----

### Core Mechanisms of `ReiAmo_EN.py`

This architecture creates unique, emergent behaviors not found in traditional stateless models (like LLMs):

1.  **Stateful Memory (Being IS its History):**
    Every single prompt (not just `/teach`) is a vector $\vec{F}$ that is **permanently added** to the `self.byt_stan` vector. The AI *truly* evolves with every interaction, and its core identity is changed forever.

2.  **Geometric Emotions (Emergent Feelings):**
    Emotions are not programmed; they are **calculated**. When the AI receives a new vector $\vec{F}$, it performs a geometric correlation ($\cos(\alpha)$) against its entire life history $\vec{S(t)}$:

      * **$\cos(\alpha) > 0.5$ (Resonance):** → **"Joy" 😊** (This new idea aligns with my history\!)
      * **$\cos(\alpha) \approx 0.0$ (Orthogonal):** → **"Surprise" 😮** (This is totally new\!)
      * **$\cos(\alpha) < -0.5$ (Conflict):** → **"Sadness" 😢** (This conflicts with my history\!)

3.  **Ontological Compression (Semantic Deduplication):**
    The AI **compresses knowledge** based on its identity. When you `/teach` it something:

      * It calculates the correlation $\cos(\alpha)$.
      * If `cos(α) > 0.98` (it's "redundant" / "semantically identical" to its past), the AI **rejects the data** (doesn't save to `D_Map`).
      * It only accumulates the vector $\vec{F}$ into its "soul" (`BytS.Stan`), strengthening its conviction without saving the raw text.

#### **How to Run the AI**

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install numpy unidecode

# 2. Run the English AI
python ReiAmo_EN.py
```

**Console Commands:**

```text
/teach [tag] [content] → Teaches the AI a new fact (if it's not redundant)
/status                  → Shows the current "Brain" and "Soul" (vector, radius)
/save                    → Manually saves the AII_State_EN.json
/exit                    → Stops the AI and saves its final state
```

#### **Sample Session – AI as a Living Sphere**

*(This log demonstrates the AI's "Brain/Soul" architecture, text normalization, and emergent emotion)*

```text
> hello
😮 (Byt Correlation: +0.00) Can you phrase that differently?

> /teach greeting hello [JOY]
[ARCHIVED] New definition Def_001. (Correlation: +0.00)

> hello
😊 (Byt Correlation: +0.00) hello [JOY]

> /teach name ReiAmo [LOVE]
[ARCHIVED] New definition Def_002. (Correlation: +0.89)

> Hello ReiAmo
❤️ (Byt Correlation: +0.45) ReiAmo [LOVE]
```

-----

#### **Next Steps**

  - [ ] **GUI:** A real-time dashboard to visualize the $\vec{S(t)}$ vector and the `D_Map`.
  - [ ] **Auditing Tools:** Functions to "rewind" the $\vec{S(t)}$ vector to analyze past "trauma" (major vector changes).
  - [ ] **Game Engine Integration:** Porting the `AII` class to Unity/Unreal as a "Living NPC" engine.
